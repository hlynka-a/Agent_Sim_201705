Hi Andrew,

Thank you so much for this! It was incredibly helpful.  I'm thinking, at this point, 
it's likely your interview will be Monday or Tuesday, based on the availability of 
Sharon Broude Geva's (whose calendar I do manage), but we will see.

I forgot the important detail: the interview is expected to last 90 minutes.

Also, there is a request for you to provide some code:

Program the motion of two circular agents from some initial point to a final location 
through a door that only allows one agent through at a time. In writing code for this, 
you need to make sure that each circle moves logically, does not overlap with another 
(by slowing down), and can navigate. 

Please animate the results and allow us to specify some initial parameters 
(e.g. agent speed or size) during the interview.

I will be in touch, hopefully soon, with a scheduled time.

(Also, in better news, we're into our spring semester and the bulk of the student 
and faculty body have gone home for the summer)
